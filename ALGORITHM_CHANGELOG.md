# COWP Algorithm Change Log

This is the canonical record of algorithm attempts. Do not repeat a rejected
change without new evidence. Every experiment must record the code version, data
version, seed, checkpoint lineage, learned-offline gate, online paired metrics,
and the exact simulator-agent setting.

## v8 — Aggregate structured certificate

- Added a threshold-connected hard certificate and a candidate-level classifier.
- Result: false-safe selection and burden decreased, but EP collapsed and fallback rose sharply.
- Rejected shortcut: threshold relaxation alone. Pair witness AUPRC remained about 0.43.

## v9 — Primitive-indexed transport supervision

- Added direct mode conflict/retain labels, response-root assignment and response auxiliary losses.
- Fixed hidden NPZ enumeration and response-root gather dimensionality.
- Seed 2026 learned-offline gate failed; no real Waymax online probe was executed.
- Evidence: witness AUPRC 0.4312, accepted NCF recall 0.1280, accepted candidate rate 0.0613.
- Failure diagnosis:
  1. transport did not receive candidate--natural trajectory geometry;
  2. `FREEZE_BACKBONE_EPOCHS=999` froze candidate/natural/witness identity modules;
  3. diffuse response slots distorted same-root recovery;
  4. mode-conflict validation BCE 0.722 was worse than the class-prior entropy baseline (~0.649);
  5. the generic candidate classifier dominated the claimed pair mechanism.

## v10-GCT — Geometry-Conditioned Transport

### Changes

- Added explicit compact candidate--natural relative geometry.
- Added balanced direct mode conflict/retain supervision and raw logits.
- Added response-root refinement and granular freeze.
- Replaced unweighted all-slot recovery with response-mixture-weighted recovery.
- Preserved natural-set auxiliary training during transport learning.

### Seed 2026 result

- `val/set_transport/mode_conflict`: **0.5074**, below the no-skill entropy baseline.
- `val/set_transport/mode_retain`: **0.2800**.
- Pair witness AUPRC: **0.7161** (v9: ~0.431).
- Candidate false-safe AUPRC: **0.9043**.
- Calibrated threshold 0.50:
  - EP 0.3913 vs conventional 0.3894;
  - fallback 0.2406 vs 0.1043;
  - OPR 0.7644 vs 0.7418;
  - HBCR 0.2928 vs 0.3970;
  - selected false-safe 0.4674 vs 0.5899;
  - accepted NCF recall 0.1267;
  - accepted candidate rate 0.0585.
- Across the entire threshold sweep, maximum accepted NCF recall was only **0.1391**.
- The learned-offline gate failed and therefore **no Waymax online probe ran**.

### What worked

1. Relative geometry solved the principal pair-conflict learnability failure.
2. Direct mode labels made the primitive transport mechanism measurable.
3. Granular freeze allowed candidate/natural/transport modules to adapt.
4. The certificate produced a real safety--efficiency trade-off rather than a disconnected threshold.

### What failed

1. Candidate feasibility still used an `any/max` reduction over up to six agents. A single
   moderate pair false positive rejected an entire candidate, causing multiplicative recall collapse.
2. Response-mixture-weighted recovery did not match the existential label semantics;
   root-recovery loss remained ~0.837 and response-root CE ~2.446.
3. The generic candidate calibrator could achieve high false-safe AUPRC without proving that
   primitive option transport caused the gain.
4. Attached sparse Waymax outcomes had unequal coverage and were not an online closed-loop result.

### Decision

- **Keep and strengthen** geometry-conditioned primitive conflict/retain learning.
- **Replace**, rather than tune, pairwise max/any candidate aggregation.
- **Do not** claim closed-loop superiority or SOTA from v10.

## v11-BCOT — Budgeted Counterfactual Option Transport (current)

### Hypothesis

The paper's object is the amount of low-burden natural option mass removed by an
ego candidate, not whether any one pair score crosses a threshold. Candidate
feasibility should therefore be a budget over transported option deficit, with a
separate high-confidence veto only for genuinely severe protected-priority pairs.

### Changes

1. **Pair transport deficit**
   - unrecovered conflicted natural mass;
   - burden excess on conflicted mass;
   - OPR shortfall.
2. **Candidate BCOT risk**
   - priority-weighted mean deficit;
   - smooth tail-risk deficit;
   - severe protected-pair probability.
3. **Budget gate**
   - threshold sweep now operates on candidate BCOT risk;
   - legacy pairwise `any/max` is retained only as an explicit ablation.
4. **Existential same-root recovery**
   - top response slots use a bounded fuzzy existential `max`;
   - duplicate or diffuse response slots cannot manufacture recovery;
   - a uniform root assignment contributes only `1/M`.
5. **Mechanism isolation**
   - the new candidate calibrator receives only transport statistics, not the generic candidate latent;
   - its final layer is zero-initialized for v10 checkpoint compatibility.
6. **Direct candidate-budget supervision**
   - disjoint NCF vs false-safe BCE;
   - within-scene NCF--false-safe ranking loss.
7. **Evaluation and fail-fast checks**
   - report `BCOT/FalseSafe_AUPRC` and `BCOT/RiskRankingPairAccuracy`;
   - gate checks the calibrated sweep point, not merely the default threshold;
   - require pair AUPRC >= 0.60 and BCOT false-safe AUPRC >= 0.65 before Waymax;
   - automatically run the pairmax ablation on the second GPU.

### Required evidence before promotion

Development gate:

- pair witness AUPRC >= 0.60;
- BCOT false-safe AUPRC >= 0.65;
- accepted NCF recall >= 0.30;
- accepted candidate rate >= 0.10;
- fallback <= 0.25;
- selected false-safe improvement >= 8 percentage points.

Paper-quality target:

- accepted NCF recall >= 0.50;
- fallback no more than conventional + 0.03;
- EP >= conventional or within a paired non-inferiority margin;
- relative selected false-safe reduction >= 25%;
- root-transport/BCOT significantly better than pairmax, candidate-only, soft-burden and planner-score ablations;
- 1000-scenario development and 5000-scenario x 3-seed paired online evaluation with confidence intervals.

## Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not claim closed-loop results from attached sparse Waymax candidate outcomes.
- Do not report SOTA from 100 scenes, one seed, or unmatched scenario subsets.
- Do not relax the gate merely to make the pipeline continue.
- Do not add log-divergence loss while finite label coverage is zero.
- Do not interpret generic candidate-classifier gains as proof of primitive transport.
- Do not repeat v10 pairwise max/any aggregation except as the registered ablation.
- Do not rebuild WOMD/tensor/transport caches for v11; the v9 sidecars are schema-compatible.

## v11-BCOT — Seed 2026 postmortem (do not promote)

### Observed result

The submitted `cowp_v11_bcot_probe100_seed2026` run stopped at the learned-offline
mechanism gate; no COWP Waymax probe or full online result was produced.

- pair witness AUPRC: **0.6808**;
- BCOT false-safe AUPRC: **0.4115**;
- BCOT within-scene NCF--false-safe ranking accuracy: **0.8306**;
- generic candidate false-safe AUPRC: **0.9003**;
- calibrated operating point (`0.40`, selected by least violation):
  - EP **0.3538** vs conventional **0.3870**;
  - fallback **0.2731** vs conventional **0.1043**;
  - OPR **0.8005** vs conventional **0.7426**;
  - HBCR **0.2529** vs conventional **0.3964**;
  - selected false-safe **0.4255** vs conventional **0.5881**;
  - accepted NCF recall **0.2011**;
  - accepted candidate rate **0.0831**.
- no sweep point met NCF recall >= 0.30 and fallback <= 0.25.

### Root causes found by code/log audit

1. **Transport-stage candidate supervision was absent.**
   `stage=witness` did not load `false_safe` or `noncoercive_feasible`, so
   `set_transport/candidate_budget` was exactly zero for every transport epoch.
2. **Option preservation was double-counted.**
   `mode_retained_low_safe` already means non-conflicting and low-burden, but the
   forward pass multiplied it again by `(1 - conflict_prob)`, systematically
   depressing OPR and acceptance.
3. **The existential burden statistic was mixture-weighted.**
   `_soft_min_burden` mixed response likelihood into a set-existence predicate,
   allowing a low-probability slot to be treated as unavailable even when it was
   a valid low-burden response.
4. **Natural-option drift invalidated root transport.**
   Validation natural set minADE rose from roughly 48 m to above 60 m during the
   witness stage.  A root certificate cannot be identified when its root
   trajectories move by tens of metres.
5. **The response bank was not root-conditioned.**
   It generated generic unordered response slots and then solved a difficult
   24-way root classification problem.  Root recovery remained about 0.86--0.88
   loss and response-root CE about 2.5--2.8.
6. **Two thresholds had been conflated.**
   The pair witness confidence threshold and candidate BCOT budget have different
   meanings but shared one evaluation parameter, making calibration ambiguous.
7. **The generic candidate certificate was not mechanism evidence.**
   The reported high candidate AUPRC came from a transport calibrator/generic
   latent path rather than a causal root-transport decision path.
8. **Dense response decoding was silently disabled outside response/all stages.**
   Enabling response trajectories in witness/planner configuration did not make
   the model decode them.

### Decision

- Keep: candidate--natural relative geometry, direct mode-conflict supervision,
  pair witness localization, burden decomposition, and budget rather than
  pairwise `any/max` aggregation.
- Replace: response-bank-defined root recovery, shared threshold calibration,
  silent missing-label behavior, and generic-certificate-controlled selection.
- Do not tune v11 further.  The dominant failures are semantic/structural, not a
  learning-rate or threshold issue.

## v12-RIOT — Root-Indexed Option Transport (current repair)

### Core algorithm change

For every critical agent and every natural option root `m`, v12 predicts the
primitive event

`T[k,i,m] = P(exists valid, safe, low-burden response under ego candidate k that preserves root m)`.

This root-indexed event is now the primary certificate.  Candidate BCOT risk is
computed from unrecovered natural-option mass, burden excess, OPR shortfall, and
a separate severe protected-priority veto.  The unordered response bank remains
only an auxiliary reconstruction/interpretability head.

### Implemented fixes

1. Load candidate `false_safe`, `noncoercive_feasible`, conventional-safety,
   utility, neutral/logged flags and beta labels in witness as well as planner
   stages.
2. Fail fast when required candidate or transport labels are missing; never
   silently replace missing supervision by all-negative targets.
3. Add candidate-budget label coverage, NCF rate and false-safe rate diagnostics;
   invalidate witness checkpoints with zero budget coverage.
4. Factor mode output into conflict and conditional low-safe retention, avoiding
   duplicate conflict suppression in OPR.
5. Supervise direct natural-root recovery by scatter-reducing explicit response
   slot labels (`valid & safe & low_burden & response_root_index`).
6. Preserve legacy response-root reconstruction only as
   `response_root_exist_aux` with low auxiliary weight.
7. Remove response-mixture probability from the existential soft minimum burden.
8. Add a dedicated natural-basis repair stage, freeze graph during natural
   repair, freeze the repaired natural module during witness training, and set
   witness natural auxiliary weight to zero.
9. Separate `pair_witness_threshold` from `candidate_transport_budget` throughout
   offline and Waymax evaluation.
10. Add one-pass BCOT budget sweep and `31_calibrate_bcot_budget.py`.
11. Make the main selector transport-pure: generic candidate certificate is
    retained only as an ablation/diagnostic; rule, action and rollout risks remain
    explicit safety shields.
12. Wire dense response decoding correctly for witness/planner when enabled; the
    default v12 run keeps it disabled to avoid unnecessary memory because RIOT
    does not depend on dense decoded response trajectories.
13. Add `32_gate_natural_basis.py`; transport training is prohibited unless the
    repaired natural basis passes the registered minADE thresholds.
14. Add pairmax and Pareto-frontier ablation configs and a two-GPU v12 driver.

### Validation performed before release

- `python -m compileall`: pass;
- full test suite: **70 passed**;
- `bash -n run_cowp_v12_dual_gpu.sh`: pass.

### v12 promotion gates

Before any online claim:

- natural set minADE <= 12 m;
- branch, neutral and priority minADE <= 15 m;
- candidate-budget supervision coverage > 0;
- pair witness AUPRC >= 0.60 (paper target >= 0.70);
- BCOT false-safe AUPRC >= 0.65 (paper target >= 0.75);
- direct conflict-conditioned root-transport AUPRC >= 0.65 (paper target >= 0.75);
- accepted NCF recall >= 0.30 (paper target >= 0.50);
- accepted candidate rate >= 0.10 (paper target >= 0.20);
- fallback <= 0.25 during development and <= conventional + 0.03 for paper;
- selected false-safe reduction >= 8 percentage points during development and
  >= 25% relative for paper;
- EP non-inferior to conventional at the paired scenario level.

### Required ablations for the paper

- RIOT/BCOT full model;
- legacy pairmax aggregation;
- response-bank-only recovery (disable direct root recovery);
- generic candidate certificate only;
- no natural pretraining/freeze;
- no observational, neutral or priority-preserving branch;
- no option preservation;
- soft burden cost only;
- oracle natural roots and oracle response roots as upper bounds.

### Additional prohibited shortcuts

- Do not run online evaluation when natural-basis or mechanism gates fail.
- Do not select a `least_violation` BCOT budget for a paper table; that status is
  diagnostic only.
- Do not call RIOT effective unless direct root recovery beats the response-bank
  auxiliary and pairmax ablations under paired evaluation.
- Do not claim reactive multi-agent evaluation while
  `actual_non_ego_policy=logged_replay`.


### v12 release hardening and direct mechanism observability

15. Learned-offline evaluation now requires compact response/root labels and reports
    `RootTransport/LowSafeExist_AUPRC`,
    `RootTransport/ConflictConditioned_AUPRC`,
    `RootTransport/ConflictConditioned_Recall@0.5`, the legacy auxiliary
    response-bank AUPRC, and natural-root assignment minADE.  This prevents a
    candidate-level BCOT score from being mistaken for proof that root-indexed
    option transport was learned.
16. The mechanism verifier now has an independent direct root-transport AUPRC
    gate.  The v12 driver uses 0.65 for development and blocks Waymax probe/full
    runs unless the saved mechanism report has `pass=true`.
17. Witness/planner supervision preflight now probes 32 evenly spaced cache items
    instead of the first eight, reducing shard-order false negatives for rare
    false-safe/NCF labels.
18. External repaired natural checkpoints must provide `NATURAL_HISTORY`; the
    natural-basis gate can no longer accidentally inspect an unrelated/missing
    local history file.
19. `planner_eval` loads only compact response/root targets, never dense response
    trajectories/components, so direct mechanism evaluation remains memory-bounded.

Validation after hardening:

- `pytest -q`: **70 passed**;
- `python -m compileall cowp tests`: pass;
- `bash -n run_cowp_v12_dual_gpu.sh`: pass.

## v13-TKN — Temporal-Kinematic Natural Basis and Protocol-Safe Closed Loop

### Triggering evidence from `cowp_v12_riot_probe100_seed2026`

The supplied v12 result directory contains only copied configs and
`checkpoints/natural/history_natural.json`; it contains no natural checkpoint,
transport/planner history or checkpoint, learned-offline report, probe result, or
Waymax result.  The run therefore stopped before RIOT was trained or evaluated.

The best recorded natural-basis row is epoch 7:

- validation set minADE: **41.2888 m**;
- branch minADE: **42.0075 m**;
- observational / neutral / priority minADE: **43.6674 / 40.7546 / 39.9407 m**;
- neutral consistency: **53.9360 m**;
- source CE: **1.0215**, improving only **0.00185** over the run;
- priority BCE: **0.6673**, improving only **0.00154**;
- composite checkpoint score: **42.6445**.

A v13 recheck fails every registered v12 natural gate.  This is not evidence
against RIOT itself, because RIOT never received an identifiable natural root
basis and no transport/planner/online result exists.

### Root causes

1. The old natural trajectory head projected one agent token directly to all
   `M x T x 7` values.  Its mode embedding did not participate in trajectory
   decoding and there was no explicit time representation or motion prior.
2. Natural alternatives are unordered, but source and priority semantics were
   supervised mainly as aggregate distributions rather than on the trajectory
   mode matched to each ground-truth root.  Root identity was therefore weakly
   identifiable.
3. Neutral consistency used source-neutral probability without the mode mixture
   probability, so even negligible modes contributed equally; the corresponding
   validation error stayed near 54 m.
4. The v12 gate had no dataset/oracle diagnostic and no short-horizon metrics,
   making it impossible to distinguish coordinate/track misalignment from a bad
   decoder using the result package alone.
5. Online `ClosedLoopPredFSR/CBS/OPR` are predictions of the same network that
   selects the candidate.  They are health diagnostics, not counterfactual
   ground truth and cannot independently validate the paper mechanism.
6. The real Waymax evaluator controls only the SDC.  Non-ego agents follow log
   playback.  The previous config described this correctly but the field was not
   enforced or emitted in the result JSON.
7. Replanning had no plan-stitching/hysteresis term, allowing high-frequency
   candidate switching even when every individual lattice trajectory was valid.
8. `metrics_from_labels` had a latent missing-field crash caused by an undefined
   `valid` variable in fallback burden/OPR allocation.

### Implemented changes

1. Added `temporal_kinematic` natural decoding:
   - constant-velocity anchor baseline;
   - explicit mode and time embeddings connected to trajectory generation;
   - bounded cumulative position/yaw residuals and bounded velocity/size offsets;
   - zero-initialized residual head, so a new model starts exactly at the
     kinematic baseline;
   - `legacy_linear` retained for a controlled ablation.
2. Added matched-mode semantic supervision: nearest-trajectory matching now binds
   source CE and priority BCE to the recovered natural root.
3. Corrected neutral consistency weighting to use both mixture probability and
   neutral-source probability.
4. Added validation natural minADE at 1 s, 3 s, 5 s, and 8 s.
5. Hardened `32_gate_natural_basis.py` with semantic-learning checks and optional
   kinematic-oracle comparison.
6. Added `33_diagnose_cache_alignment.py` for raw/transport tensor equality,
   critical track-to-input mapping, current/future coordinate consistency,
   transport-root ranges, and Waymax outcome/log-divergence coverage.
7. Added `34_diagnose_natural_oracles.py`, a 15-trajectory acceleration/yaw-rate
   bank that reports source-stratified 1/3/5/8 s oracle minADE.
8. Added online plan-continuity risk after the hard feasibility/frontier filter.
   It can reorder feasible candidates but cannot make a rejected candidate
   feasible.  The same regularizer is applied to internal baselines.
9. Waymax outputs now explicitly include:
   - `actual_non_ego_policy=logged_replay`;
   - `reactive_mixture_implemented=false`;
   - `mechanism_ground_truth_available_online=false`;
   - proxy-only markers for online model-predicted mechanism diagnostics.
   The evaluator raises an error if a config falsely requests a reactive non-ego
   policy without an implemented actor wrapper.
10. Fixed the missing optional witness-array crash in label-only metrics.
11. Added `STOP_AFTER_STAGE=natural|transport|planner|offline|probe` to make each
    promotion gate independently executable.  A natural-only run no longer
    requires transport caches unless transport diagnostics/later stages are
    requested.
12. Added v13 configs and `run_cowp_v13_dual_gpu.sh`.

### What is and is not validated

Validated locally without WOMD/Waymax data:

- YAML parsing;
- Python compilation;
- driver shell syntax;
- temporal decoder kinematic initialization;
- proxy protocol markers and missing-field metric fallback;
- full test suite: **73 passed**.

Not yet validated, because the uploaded package does not include the actual
raw/transport caches, the initialization checkpoint, or a Waymax installation:

- real cache coordinate/track alignment;
- v13 natural-basis convergence;
- RIOT direct root-transport AUPRC;
- planner selection gains;
- logged-replay Waymax metrics;
- reactive-agent counterfactual burden reduction.

### Promotion policy

- Do not continue beyond natural training unless the v13 natural gate passes.
- Do not run Waymax unless learned-offline mechanism verification passes.
- Do not use sparse attached candidate outcomes as the sole planner objective or
  as a full validation result.
- Keep log-divergence loss/reporting disabled until finite label coverage is
  measured; the supplied cache audit reports zero finite log-divergence labels.
- Do not call logged-replay Waymax evaluation reactive or use model-predicted
  online FSR/CBS/OPR as causal ground truth.
- A paper-ready result requires paired full-validation comparisons, confidence
  intervals, and a separately labelled reactive-agent protocol.
13. Keep the sparse Waymax outcome head as auxiliary supervision, but disable it
    in the primary v13 selector by default (`candidate_selection_outcome_weight=0`,
    `candidate_outcome_risk_mix=0`, online penalty `0`, threshold `1.10`).  It must
    be re-enabled only as a registered ablation after checkpoint-selected
    validation replay coverage is reported.
